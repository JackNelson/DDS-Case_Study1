	- [ ] Spelling and Grammar?
- [ ] Answers 
	- [ ] Are the answers clear?
	- [x] Are the answers correct? nshaver: I like the plot for question 4, but the x-axis should have units--the GDP is reported in millions of US dollars. Here is a revised version of the answer to the question--Plotting the GDP for all of the countries and coloring by Income.Group, we notice that the "Low Income" and "Lower middle Income" groups tend to have lower GDP's than "High Income" groups. Additionally, countries part of the OECD have higher GDP than those that are not part of the OECD. Vizualizing the data in this way also enables us to see the outliers in each Income Group--USA and China have higher GDPs than most of their respective groups, while Tuvalu (TUV) has a lower GDP than the rest of it's income group. 
	- [ ] Q5 is not the right version of the answer--cose is wrong and the answer should be 5. 
	- [ ] Q1 is wrong as we need the correct version of cleanup_ED_GDP.R--the right version removes the unranked countries
	- [ ] Spelling and Grammar?
- [ ] Conclusion
	- [ ] Does it summarize findings from the excercise in paragraph form? nshaver: I struggled with making conclusions from this random set of statistics and graphs. How about this for the last sentance "Examining GDP by country code shows many countries have a GDP between 175 million and 3 trillion dollars, and generally countries in the "Low Income" income groups have lower GDP than countries in the "High Income GDP" groups. Also, countries that are members of the OECD tend to have higher GDP than non-member countries. 
	- [ ] Spelling and Grammar?
